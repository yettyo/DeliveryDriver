Once the player takes a delivery, car color will turn to green; hinting that the player is now carrying a package, cannot carry more than one package at a time, and now is ready for delivery.

These are speed boosters, it will increase the speed of the car after the player runs over them, if the player bumps into anything around the map the player will lose this boost and will go back to it's normal speed.

These purple avatars are the customers waiting for their delivery. In total there are 10 customers located all around the map.

![Gameplay 4](https://github.com/yettyo/DeliveryDriver/blob/main/Screenshots/DD%20In-game%20screenshots/Gameplay4.png?raw=true)

After a successful delivery, customers will disappear and delivery car will turn back to blue hinting that the car now needs to collect another package before another delivery.
